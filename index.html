      I don't have any particular fields of computer science that I want to jump into for my first job, so long as the pay and work environment are good.

      As a hobby, I've been looking into indie game development on Unity. I might turn it into a side job in the future if there's money to be made, but I'm going to prioritize treating it as a fun, personal project.
